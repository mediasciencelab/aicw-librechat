# Libre-Chat deployment

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Domain hosted zone already configured in Route 53

## Requirements

### packer

See [Packer website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer)

```shell
brew install packer
```

### docker

See [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/)

## Build for deployment

### Docker image

The docker image is built as part of the AMI build process. However, if you want to build the
docker image separately, you can do so using the `docker compose` command. This will build the
image to your locally running docker daemon.

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.mediasci.yml build
```

**Package Management:** The project uses pnpm for development but the Dockerfile uses npm. If you
encounter dependency issues during Docker builds, ensure both lock files are synchronized:

```shell
./scripts/update-lockfiles.sh
```

This script generates both `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package-lock.json` files to maintain
compatibility between the development environment (pnpm) and Docker builds (npm).

### EC2 AMI

Once the docker image is built, the AMI can be built using the `packer` command. The
`<environment>` parameter should match the stage name you plan to deploy to (e.g., "dev",
"staging", "prod"):

```shell
packer build -var env=<environment>  packer/templates/libre-chat
```

**Example:**
```shell
packer build -var env=staging packer/templates/libre-chat
```

### Deploying EC2 AMI to environment

AMIs are automatically selected by the deployment based on tags. For a given stage "my-env", the
deployment will use the latest AMI that:
- Has a name starting with `aiwc-librechat-`
- Is tagged with `mediasci:env:my-env` = `true`
- Is tagged with `mediasci:project` = `aicw`

**AMI Tagging:** When you build an AMI with `packer build -var env=my-env`, it automatically gets
tagged for that environment.

**Promoting AMIs between environments:**

You can promote an existing AMI from one environment to another without rebuilding:

```shell
./scripts/promote-ami.sh <source-env> <destination-env>
```

**Example:**
```shell
./scripts/promote-ami.sh dev prod
```

**WARNING:** In order to deploy a new AMI to an existing environment, it is necessary to
*manually* delete the reference to the old AMI from your local `cdk.context.json` file. This is
because the CDK will not update the AMI reference if it is already set.

## Infrastructure Architecture

The infrastructure uses a shared VPC model with separate stacks for different concerns:

**Note:** Throughout this documentation, "stage" and "environment" are used interchangeably. Both
refer to deployment targets like "dev", "staging", or "trajector".

### Stack Overview

1. **Global Stack** (`--stage global`): Creates shared VPC infrastructure used by all
   environments
2. **Domain Stack**: Manages SSL certificates and DNS configuration
3. **Static Stack**: Creates environment-specific resources (KMS keys, EIP, etc.)
4. **Storage Stack**: Manages EBS volumes
5. **LoadBalancer Stack**: Application load balancer configuration
6. **Instance Stack**: EC2 instance and target group configuration

### Deployment Order

**First-time setup:**

1. Deploy the Global stack to create shared VPC:
   ```shell
   pnpm sst deploy --stage global
   ```

2. Deploy environment-specific stacks:
   ```shell
   pnpm sst deploy --stage <env>
   ```

### Environment Management

**Temporarily disabling an environment:**

To reduce costs or temporarily disable an environment while preserving storage and secrets, you
can remove stacks in reverse dependency order. This preserves EBS volumes, KMS keys, secrets,
and Elastic IP addresses:

```shell
# Remove stacks in reverse dependency order
pnpm sst remove --stage <env> Instance
pnpm sst remove --stage <env> LoadBalancer
pnpm sst remove --stage <env> Domain
```

**Important:** Always remove in this order to avoid dependency conflicts. The Static and Storage
stacks are preserved to maintain persistent resources.

**Re-enabling a disabled environment:**

To restore a temporarily disabled environment, redeploy stacks in dependency order:

```shell
# Deploy stacks in dependency order
pnpm sst deploy --stage <env> Domain
pnpm sst deploy --stage <env> LoadBalancer
pnpm sst deploy --stage <env> Instance
```

## Version Tags

The repository maintains several types of version tags to track important milestones and
architectural changes:

### Archive Tags
- **archive/unshared-vpc** (2025-05-05) - Marks the project before migrating to shared VPC
  architecture
- **archive/v0.7.7** (2025-08-11) - This represents the last change before migrating to v0.8.x.

### MediaSci Fork Tags
- **mediasci/fork-1** (2025-04-01) - First point in upstream repository where fork occured.
- **mediasci/fork-2** (2025-08-12) - Second point in upstream repository where fork occured.
  This was where v0.8.0-rc2 was defined.

**Tag Usage:**
- `archive/` tags mark significant infrastructure changes or major refactoring points
- `mediasci/` tags track specific fork points
- These tags serve as reference points for understanding the evolution of the deployment
  architecture and codebase

### Setting environment secrets

Each environment requires several secrets to function properly. These secrets are encrypted using
the environment's KMS key and stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

**Step 1: Deploy `Static` stack to create KMS key**

```shell
pnpm sst deploy --stage <env> Static
```

**Step 2: Create secrets file**

Create a file containing the required secrets in this format:

```shell
CREDS_KEY=<credential key>
CREDS_IV=<credential IV>
JWT_SECRET=<JWT secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<JWT refresh secret>
MEILI_MASTER_KEY=<MeiliSearch master key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OpenAI API key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<Anthropic API key>
```

**Step 3: Upload secrets**

```shell
./scripts/upload-secrets.sh -s <env> <path-to-secrets-file>
```

**Example:**
```shell
./scripts/upload-secrets.sh -s staging ./secrets/trajector.env
```

**How secrets are used:** The LibreChat application automatically retrieves these encrypted
secrets from Parameter Store at startup using the KMS key to decrypt them.

# User management

You can use scripts in the `scripts` directory to remotely manage users on the EC2 instance.

**Prerequisites for user management scripts:**
- AWS CLI configured with permissions for EC2, Systems Manager Parameter Store, and KMS
- SSH access to the target environment's EC2 instance

**Stage selection:** All scripts will by default use the stage set in the `.sst/stage` file. To
explicitly use a specific stage, use the `-s` flag on each command. If the `.sst/stage` file
doesn't exist, you must use the `-s` flag.

## Adding SSH key to agent

Before running any of the scripts, you need to add the SSH key to the agent. This is done using
the `scripts/ssh-add-instance.sh`. The SSH key is specific to each environment. Like all
commands, you can use the `-s` flag to specify the environment or it will attempt to use the
stage in the `.sst/stage` file.

**Example:**

```shell
./scripts/ssh-add-instance.sh -s trajector
```

## SSH to instance

One can simply SSH to the instance using the `scripts/ssh-instance.sh` script. This assumes you
have already added the SSH key to the agent using the `ssh-add-instance.sh` script. Like all
commands, you can use the `-s` flag to specify the environment or it will attempt to use the
stage in the `.sst/stage` file.

**Example:**

```shell
./scripts/ssh-instance.sh -s trajector
```

## LibreChat Container Shell Access

You can open an interactive shell directly inside the LibreChat Docker container using the
`scripts/librechat-shell.sh` script. This is useful for debugging, running ad-hoc commands, or
exploring the container environment.

**Example:**

```shell
./scripts/librechat-shell.sh -s trajector
```

This will open a shell (`/bin/sh`) inside the running LibreChat container on the specified
environment's EC2 instance.

## Backup Management

### Creating EBS Snapshots

You can create EBS snapshots of your environment's storage volume using the backup script:

```shell
./scripts/create-db-snapshot.sh -s <stage>
```

**Options:**
- `-s <stage>` - Specify the environment stage (uses file `.sst/stage` if not already written)
- `-d <description>` - Custom snapshot description (optional)
- `--no-stop` - Skip stopping/starting the instance (may result in inconsistent snapshot)

**Examples:**
```shell
# Create snapshot for trajector environment
./scripts/create-db-snapshot.sh -s trajector

# Create snapshot with custom description
./scripts/create-db-snapshot.sh -s staging -d "Pre-upgrade backup"
```

The script will:
- Retrieve the EBS Volume ID from the Storage stack
- Stop the EC2 instance to ensure data consistency (if Instance stack exists)
- Create a timestamped snapshot with consistent tagging
- Restart the EC2 instance
- Provide monitoring command for checking snapshot progress

**Note:** The script automatically stops and restarts the EC2 instance during snapshot creation to
ensure database consistency. This results in brief downtime (~1-2 minutes) but guarantees a clean,
consistent backup.

### Listing EBS Snapshots

You can list existing EBS snapshots for an environment:

```shell
./scripts/list-db-snapshots.sh -s <stage>
```

**Example:**
```shell
# List snapshots for trajector environment
./scripts/list-db-snapshots.sh -s trajector
```

The script displays snapshots in a table format showing:
- Snapshot ID
- Creation time
- Description
- Snapshot name

### Restoring from EBS Snapshots

You can restore an environment from an EBS snapshot using the restore script:

```shell
./scripts/restore-db-snapshot.sh -s <stage> -n <snapshot-id>
```

**Options:**
- `-s <stage>` - Specify the environment stage
- `-n <snapshot-id>` - The snapshot ID to restore from (get this from `list-db-snapshots.sh`)

**Example:**
```shell
# Restore trajector environment from a specific snapshot
./scripts/restore-db-snapshot.sh -s trajector -n snap-12345678901234567
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** This operation will:
- Stop the EC2 instance
- Replace the current EBS volume with a new one created from the snapshot
- All data since the snapshot was created will be LOST
- The instance will restart with the restored data

**How it works:**
1. Verifies the snapshot exists and is in a completed state
2. Stops the EC2 instance and removes the Instance stack
3. Removes the Storage stack (destroying the current volume)
4. Writes the snapshot ID to `.snapshot-id.<stage>` file
5. Redeploys the Storage stack, which reads the snapshot ID from the file
6. Redeploys the remaining stacks to restart the instance

**Technical Implementation Note:**
The snapshot restoration uses a file-based approach (`.snapshot-id.<stage>`) to pass the snapshot
ID to the Storage stack during deployment. This approach was chosen because:
- EBS volumes must specify their snapshot ID at creation time - it cannot be changed later
- SST Config.Parameter values are fixed when the stack is defined, not read dynamically
- SST Config.Secret values can only be accessed inside Lambda functions, not during stack synthesis
- Environment variables from .env files were not being loaded consistently during deployment

The `.snapshot-id.*` files are gitignored except for the `trajector` and `epic` stages.
